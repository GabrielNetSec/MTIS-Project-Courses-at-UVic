## “Roommate Wi-Fi Sharing: Balancing Router Capacity and User Experience” 
https://github.com/GabrielNetSec/MTIS-Project-Courses-at-UVic/blob/main/Roommate%20WiFi%20Sharing_Gabriel%20Naranjo.pdf

### Objective

In shared living environments, optimizing Internet resources is crucial for cost efficiency and user satisfaction. This study aims to estimate the maximum number of roommates who can share an Internet subscription using an IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n wireless router without compromising a decent Internet experience for each user. By modelling user Internet activity with Markov chains and considering the upstream and downstream capacity limits alongside the router's capacity, we develop an analytical framework to determine the optimal number of users. The results provide valuable insights for network planning in residential settings.
